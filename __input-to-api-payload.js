/**
 * @fileoverview This file contains the logic to "translate" each CSV record from input file

/**
 * Converts a CSV record from migration input file to a Cloudinary API payload.
 * 
 * 💡Customize this function to suit your needs as per the Cloudinary Upload API specs:
 * https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference#upload
 * 
 * Consider below implementation as a "starter".
 * 
 * Typically you'd customize this module to:
 *  - Define which field from the input CSV record to use for the asset URL
 *  - Define how to pass the input CSV record fields with Cloudinary Upload API as the asset's taxonomy (tags, metadata, DAM folder etc.)
 * 
 * @param {Object} csvRec - CSV record from the migration input file
 * @returns {Object} - parameters for Cloudinary API call
 *  - file: the URL to obtain the asset from
 *  - options: options for the Cloudinary Upload API call
